<p>Anyone who has spent time in a lab has likely hunched over a microscope at some point. They are standard instruments for visualizing and investigating small objects. The problem is that microscopes are relatively large and expensive, which can be a barrier to people with an interest in science or microscopy but who can&#x2019;t afford this bulky piece of equipment. This can also make work outside of the lab challenging, especially if you find yourself trying to explore something tiny out in the middle of a jungle or in an under-developed country.</p>
<p>This is where the &#x201C;<a href="http://www.foldscope.com/">Foldscope</a>&#x201D; comes in, a device developed by the <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/%7Emanup/Foldscope.html">Prakash Lab</a> at Stanford University . This <strong>origami-based optical microscope</strong> weighs in at a whopping 8.8 grams (less than two nickels), is small enough to fit in a pocket, and costs less than one dollar.</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.thenextgenscientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/foldscope-start.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="1291" data-permalink="https://microcosmos.foldscope.com/?p=1291" data-orig-file="" data-orig-size="" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="[]" data-image-title="Two animals, a fungus and a houseplant" data-image-description="&lt;p&gt;Anyone who tends&#xA0;houseplants indoors knows the risk of inviting other uninvited guests&#xA0;&#x2014; in particular various arthropods and fungi. However, with a foldscope this&#xA0;transforms into new material for investigations. I have been growing a&#xA0;woodapple tree (called Bilva in India;&#xA0;Aegle marmelos) for a few years now. This is a very popular tree in the Indian subcontinent and grows very slowly. In winters, my&#xA0;plant resides indoors in comfortable heated environments and year after year, it gives me heartaches with the pests it attracts when inside. However, a pest is only a human perspective, the evolution of flowering plants and insects is very intimate and goes back 250 million years, way before our primate ancestor existed&#x2013; so from their perspective I am perhaps the pest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, a few days ago, I noticed that several leaves were shiny and sticky and they were filled with little waxy bumps. There was also a black growth. I knew I had double- trouble. The waxy protrusions are scale insects, members of the order hemiptera that suck the sap drawn from the plant&#x2019;s vascular system and secrete a sticky and presumably sweet honeydew. This promotes the growth of a black fungus that can inundate the plant preventing it from gaining access to light and making it look rather unaesthetic. Additionally, while I watered the plant a few fungal gnats startled from the stream buzzed around the soil. So along with my plant were two animals and a fungus&#x2013; all great material for a foldscope party.&lt;/p&gt;

All&#xA0;the scales I saw on my plant are likely to be female.&lt;/p&gt;

Just pop these out, follow the instructions (it comes with an instruction manual as well as <a href="https://microcosmos.foldscope.com/assembly/">online video</a> step-by-step instructions) and the set up is complete in less than ten minutes.</p>

All&#xA0;the scales I saw on my plant are likely to be female. &#xA0;For this, I took a cellophane tape and placed it over the leaf and pulled out the scales (they came off easily) and stuck it on a glass slide. The first picture in the collage shows a scale under a 40x microscope that I have. You can clearly see the outline of the female and its two eyes and filled with eggs and larvae at various stages of development.&lt;/p&gt;

The Foldscope kit also comes with a low-magnification lens, a high-magnification lens, magnetic strips (allows for connection to a cell phone), and a light module. Slides are inserted into the platform and samples are viewed through a micro-lens while you can pan and focus with your thumbs.</p>
<p>This device could provide important opportunities for examining specimens in the field as well as <a href="http://www.foldscope.com/globalhealth/">screening and diagnostics</a> for disease-causing agents. For instance, the Foldscope can be used to detect:</p>
<ul>	<p></p>
<li><i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> (parasitic protozoan that causes <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs094/en/">malaria</a>)</li>
<p>	</p>
<li><i>Leishmania donovani</i> (parasitic protozoan that causes <a href="http://www.who.int/leishmaniasis/en/">leishmaniasis</a>)</li>
<p>	</p>
<li><i>Eschleria coli </i>(bacterium that <span class="st">can cause painful abdominal cramping and severe, sometimes bloody, diarrhea)</span></li>
<p>	</p>
<li><i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i> (parasitic protozoan that causes <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs340/en/">Chagas</a> disease)</li>
<p>	</p>
<li><span class="st">Human <a href="http://www.microscopyu.com/staticgallery/pathology/sicklecellanemia20x04.html">sickle cell</a><br></span></li>
<p>	</p>
<li><span class="st">And much more<br></span></li>
<p></p></ul>
<p>By removing cost barriers, the researchers hope that the Foldscope will provide new opportunities for a broad user base in both science education and field work for science and medicine.</p>

Here are a few images taken using the low-mag lens (140X magnification) on an Android phone: cells of a leaf (top left), sugar crystals (top right), a phytoseiid mite from my garden (bottom left), and celery stalk (bottom right). I think my preparation of the slides could be improved to produce better images, but all-in-all I&#x2019;m still amazed that these were taken using a paper-based 50-cent microscope.</p>
<p>Another important point that the authors bring up is that many children have never used a microscope, even in developed countries like the United States. A universal program providing a &#x201C;microscope for every child&#x201D; could help to foster an interest in science at an early age. They hope to make <a href="http://www.foldscope.com/scienceeducation/">microscopes approachable, accessible, and inspire children</a> to examine biodiversity on our planet as amateur microscopists and to make discoveries of their own.</p>
<p>Overall, I&#x2019;m pretty excited about this device. It&#x2019;s cheap, it&#x2019;s simple, and it works &#x2013; but this invention required an amazing amount of research and engineering by the Stanford group. I&#x2019;ll be bringing the Foldscope with me on my next trip to the <a href="http://www.perunature.com/">Peruvian Amazon</a> and hope to investigate some interesting small organisms while there. Stay tuned!</p>

		<p>@Aaron: can&#x2019;t wait to see you post from the rainforest Aaron. Who knows what you will find &#x1F642; I have been collecting data from Panama; and specially categorizing sub-mm insects. Would be fun to compare notes. Where do you typically work/visit?</p>

		<p>I conduct field work at the Tambopata Research Center, located in Southeastern Peru. I haven&#x2019;t spent as much time looking at sub-mm fauna but I&#x2019;d love to pay a little more attention to them now, especially with neotropical Acari (mites). I&#x2019;d definitely like to chat more about some of your collecting data!</p>
